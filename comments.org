* Chapter 8
** TODO In general when you show a figure you really need to describe all aspects of it, e.g. in all these figures you can comment on
   a) if data agree with either of the two models
   b) if the two models agree with each other
   c) if 2010 and 2012 data agree
   d) if there is any dependence on the x-axis value
** TODO the space on the right margin is very large. Can you please reduce it for now as it otherwise thros off my "calibration" on the number of pages somewhat!
** TODO in the introduction of a chapter, please don't just say "see XYZ" in the middle (e.g. as l346). Instead the introduction should just outline what comes and at the end you can say for instance "Sec. 8.1 describes the data and simulation. 8.2 and 8.3 present the results for the response measurements for inclusive and identified particles, respectively." or even describe it in more detail. But saying it just in the middle of a paragraph with a forward reference is not helpful as surely at this stage you are not proposing for people to look at this before reading the rest. If at all possible it is always good to avoid any forward referencing (apart from in the way I illustrate above).
** TODO in general you are not describing the figure sand what we learn from them in sufficient detail. If you show positive and negative charges in a figure together I expect to learn from the text how they compare.
** TODO all figures are a bit small. If you increase the right margin this will make them all bigger. You should also aim to use really 100% of the text width.
** TODO for the <E/p> do you include the energies <=0 or only positive energies? Need to clarify early on when introducing variable.
** TODO l333: physics => energy measurements
** TODO l334: calorimetry => calorimeters
** TODO l347: into individual cells: you mean to say that they deposit energy in several adjacent cells which are then clustered, right? And, the energy of the cluster is taken to be the energy of the particle. See if you can reformulate text along those lines.
** TODO l348: grammar incorrect => Comparing the energy response of hadrons in data to that of simulated hadrons provides...
** TODO l349: omit mention of noise here as noise is much better measured in other ways (e.g. when there are no collisions at all!)
** TODO l351: remove ":such as dependence on charge" as this is least interesting. I think you can just remove the entire sentence "These measurements....8.2.4.1"
** TODO l355: the particle types => the response to various identified particle types
** TODO l360-362: remove sentence as not needed.
** TODO l367: These => The present
** TODO l373: remove "to facilitate.... hadrons" as this was not the primary purpose, and certainly not the only purpose. The main reason was for Heavy Ion and/or soft QCD measurements I think.
** TODO l377: in the => for the 
** TODO l379: Was the reconstruction not also updated? Also, say that the updated geometry is the final best understanding of run-1.
** TODO l381: needs to say that these processes are all generated with the admixture as pythia does. Maybe better is that you just say minimum bias and refer to the chapter on the inelastic pp cross section measurement which then details the processes presumably. 
** TODO l384: each run => each dataset (?)
** TODO l384: are matched... simulations => are chosen such that they match those of the corresponding dataset.
** TODO l400: enter into the response => are selected for the response (?)
** TODO l409: is this just any track or does it also have to pass some selection criteria?
** TODO l422: particles => tracks (in two places)
** TODO l422: what does "within a given subset of particles" mean? You mean e.g. for 1<p<5 GeV? I think then just remove it or say "for the selected tracks" btu then also need to say at the end of l423 "for those tracks"
** TODO l424: remove "particle"
** TODO l426: noise => cell noise
** TODO l429: what do you mean with the "additional layers"? Do you mean the cells with >0 energy? 
** TODO fig. 2: I think this figure is in the wrong place. It does not illustrate the clustering (as it says at l432/433) at all but instead shows the background determination. It uses a lot of terms not yet introduced, and so I suggest you move it to section 8.2.3. And, maybe you can find a better figure to illustrate the topoclustering I suggest either the recent paper or the ATLAS detector paper.
** TODO fig. 2 caption: I think the caption does not really do the figure justice either. E.g. it does not show what "E" is or what "p" is.
** TODO l442: what does "similar" mean? Remove it?
** TODO l443: we don't really know that they are noise clusters. Maybe say instead "are associated to a cluster with an energy below the noise threshold which then becomes negative after the noise subtraction." That's more correct, right?
** TODO l463: measurements => and for positively and negatively charged particles
** TODO l464: which provides a ... interaction lengths => which is used to obtain results for interaction lengths ranging between 0.1 and 0.65~$\lambda$.
** TODO l467: here you argue that the differnce must come from the hadr. interaction model. However, youa re showing FTFP_BERT and QGSP_BERT and they look pretty much the same. I suspect that this is because at low p they actually both use the BERT model. I think you need a comment on this though.
** TODO l469: I find it hard to notice a difference. And, you say that there is a difference between FTFP and QGSP at low p but they seem to be very similar!? BTW, it is not great that the y-axis range is different for a) and b), maybe this makes it hard for me to see this? I would actually prefer to reduce the scale to +-30% or so (maybe +20% and -40% is better) to really see the data
** TODO fig. 2: the most striking thing for me is that the data/MC agreement gets worse at higher p. Can you comment on this?
** TODO fig. 2c+d: x-axis needs units "\lambda"
** TODO (for curiosity: did you ever make the plot vs lambda only using tracks with p>5 GeV?)
** TODO l476: remove => removing an 
** TODO l497: Figure 5 => Figure 5 for data and MC with the two different physics lists. 
** TODO Fig. 5: it would be good to comment on the values themselves when you describe in the text, i.e. say that it is about 0.1 at the lowest p and then decreases to ~0.03. (In fact I am wondering if you ever looked at just the mean E versus p instead of E/p as E should be constant vs p if it is only background! So, my question is if the decrease with p is fully explained by the fact that E=const. and p is increasing?)
** TODO l500: what does this mean? You just mean that the flux of pi0s in pythia is not right? Or, you mean that in pythia there is a coherence that there is not in data? 
** TODO sec. 8.2.4, first paragraph: it would be nice to show the actual corrected E/p distribution rather than just the mean value compared to the raw spectrum to see that in particular the tail is reduced.
** TODO l513: would be nice to show a plot of the E/p excluding the <=0 energies to show this.
** TODO fig. 6a: there is a noticeable difference between the 2010 and 2012 data of ~5%? You don't comment on this in the text?
** TODO l522: moves => moves the mean value of 
** TODO l522: remove "which is the purpose of the calibration" or say "as desired"
** TODO l525: here would be a good place to now conclude that the difference in the E/p mean comes all from the zero fraction (and then remove the text at l513 which says it already but without demonstrating it)
** TODO l526: Maybe make this "8.2.5" as there is no 8.2.4.2?
** TODO l527: need reference for the "several previous measurements". Also, for the next statement you need a reference. Otherwise it sounds like speculation which is not good in science.
** TODO l535-540: this makes it sounds like we are not placing any cut on the TRT hits but we do have the cut at >20. So, text needs a bit rewording to make this clear. Also, the particles can get stuck in the coil and then the TRT would not matter.
** TODO l538: where... are more likely => which selects tracks that are more likely to have undergone a hadronic interaction
** TODO fig. 8: it would be interesting actually to see the 0-fraction for the two cases. That is presumably much larger for the tracks with <20 TRT hits?
** TODO l549: and each compared to the data
** TODO l550: if you want to comment on the difference betwen the two charges it would be *much* better to directly overlay the two charges, e.g. on the left for data and on the right for MC or something. It is very hard to see what you say given the small size of the plots etc. 
** TODO fig. 9: there is a difference between 2010 and 2012 you don't comment on?
** TODO l557: available => measured
** TODO l557: layer => layer separately
** TODO l565: clarify that this is for the MIP selection
** TODO l567/568: "The RAW... background" move this to footnote
** TODO l571: which has => where there is a
** TODO l572: provide reference for the "similar measurements"
** TODO Fig. 12 discussion: maybe remind the reader here that for the LAr calorimeter the material is lead while for the Tile it is steel. Also, did you make this vs lambda? Would be interesting!
** TODO l598: response => the response
** TODO l600: are you describing somewhere how secondary vertices are found? Should refer back to that.
** TODO l606: say explicitly that the higher momentum particle is the proton in 98% of the cases (I think?)
** TODO l623: explain the reason for these formulae. Also, these should be labelled m_\pi or m_p etc. I think? They are different masses depending on which particles it is I mean.
** TODO l625: the fraction of 0s is actually not so large I think?
** TODO l628: explain in more words? E.g. "annihilation of the antiquarks with quarks in the protons and neutrons of the atoms in the detector"
** TODO fig. 15: it seems to me that it is worse for pi- than pi+? But hard to see!
** TODO l638: the difference decreases with increasing p. Comment on this?
** TODO l643: does a better job" is slang ;-)
** TODO l660: where do these fractions come from? Why is there a range? You need a reference for this.
** TODO l661-663: remove statement on template method. Instead, most people would think you can use phi->KK or D->Kpi. Explain why not.
** TODO l663: "noticeable difference" w.r.t. what?
** TODO l665: say explictly thathere with low you mean <1 GeV
** TODO fig. 18: you can make this figure larger.
** TODO l670: done => obtained
** TODO l675: this is the wrong way around: we switched from QGSP (run1) to FTFP (run2)
** TODO l677: remove "small", just say the number. 5% is not really "small" if one tries to have JES uncertainties of ~1-2%
** TODO l678: there are some differences at high energies, e.g. in the 0-fraction, too.
** TODO l679: energies => momenta (?)
** TODO l681: say that the discrepancies mostly in LAr, not in Tile




* Chapter 9
** TODO general: you implicitly assume here that there are no uncertainties at all on the pi0 energy scale. This needs to be stated and justified.
** TODO l687: have often => are often
** TODO l688: photon=jet and Z-jet are also use, particularly at low and intermediate pt.
** TODO l694: components => constituents
** TODO l703: simulated distribution  => momentum distribution of simulated particles
** TODO l707-709: not sure about this first sentence. Can phrase this better, e.g. "A correct modeling of jets in the data by simulation requires that both the particle production inside jets as well as the response of the calorimeter to particles are correctly modeled." 
** TODO l708: table ref not resolved
** TODO fig. 19: 
    - Is this really energy or p? Is it the truth value? presumably yes?
    - Comment more about the figure. Say e.g. that for 90-100 GeV jets less than 1% of the particles contributing have >20 GeV energy etc.
    - The y-axis label is not clear. 
** TODO l721: why are there no uncertainties related to the particle composition? This needs to be justified. I presume it was considered to be beyond the scope of this? Normally there should be uncertainties on the composition.
** TODO l725: are => is
** TODO table 1: 
    - is this E/p for the LCW?
    - how can I understand the 1-5% uncertainty in the "in situ E/p" row? Can I relate this to the plots from the previous chapter? If so, how exactly. Maybe the previous chapter should conclude on what the actual uncertainty on the response is then at the end.
    - remove "flat" from the last row. or say "independent of energy" instead of "flat"
** TODO fig. 20: when describing it in the text on previous page, it would be good to comment on what we see, e.g. that the mean is slightly below 1.0, that it is pretty flat with jet pT, what the total uncertainty is...
** TODO fig. 20 caption: The JES => The JES response 
** TODO fig. 21: this caption should say a bit more and also the y-axis label needs to be pT and not log(pT).
