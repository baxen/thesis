Beate Round

* Chapter 8
** DONE I need to go through each figure and check Beate's list
   a) if data agree with either of the two models
   b) if the two models agree with each other
   c) if 2010 and 2012 data agree
   d) if there is any dependence on the x-axis value
** DONE In general when you show a figure you really need to describe all aspects of it, e.g. in all these figures you can comment on
** DONE the space on the right margin is very large. Can you please reduce it for now as it otherwise thros off my "calibration" on the number of pages somewhat!
** DONE in the introduction of a chapter, please don't just say "see XYZ" in the middle (e.g. as l346). Instead the introduction should just outline what comes and at the end you can say for instance "Sec. 8.1 describes the data and simulation. 8.2 and 8.3 present the results for the response measurements for inclusive and identified particles, respectively." or even describe it in more detail. But saying it just in the middle of a paragraph with a forward reference is not helpful as surely at this stage you are not proposing for people to look at this before reading the rest. If at all possible it is always good to avoid any forward referencing (apart from in the way I illustrate above).
** DONE in general you are not describing the figure sand what we learn from them in sufficient detail. If you show positive and negative charges in a figure together I expect to learn from the text how they compare.
** DONE all figures are a bit small. If you increase the right margin this will make them all bigger. You should also aim to use really 100% of the text width.
** DONE for the <E/p> do you include the energies <=0 or only positive energies? Need to clarify early on when introducing variable.
** DONE l333: physics => energy measurements
** DONE l334: calorimetry => calorimeters
** DONE l347: into individual cells: you mean to say that they deposit energy in several adjacent cells which are then clustered, right? And, the energy of the cluster is taken to be the energy of the particle. See if you can reformulate text along those lines.
** DONE l348: grammar incorrect => Comparing the energy response of hadrons in data to that of simulated hadrons provides...
** DONE l349: omit mention of noise here as noise is much better measured in other ways (e.g. when there are no collisions at all!)
** DONE l351: remove ":such as dependence on charge" as this is least interesting. I think you can just remove the entire sentence "These measurements....8.2.4.1"
** DONE l355: the particle types => the response to various identified particle types
** DONE l360-362: remove sentence as not needed.
** DONE l367: These => The present
** DONE l373: remove "to facilitate.... hadrons" as this was not the primary purpose, and certainly not the only purpose. The main reason was for Heavy Ion and/or soft QCD measurements I think.
** DONE l377: in the => for the 
** DONE l379: Was the reconstruction not also updated? Also, say that the updated geometry is the final best understanding of run-1.
** DONE l381: needs to say that these processes are all generated with the admixture as pythia does. Maybe better is that you just say minimum bias and refer to the chapter on the inelastic pp cross section measurement which then details the processes presumably. 
** DONE l384: each run => each dataset (?)
** DONE l384: are matched... simulations => are chosen such that they match those of the corresponding dataset.
** DONE l400: enter into the response => are selected for the response (?)
** DONE l409: is this just any track or does it also have to pass some selection criteria?
** DONE l422: particles => tracks (in two places)
** DONE l422: what does "within a given subset of particles" mean? You mean e.g. for 1<p<5 GeV? I think then just remove it or say "for the selected tracks" btu then also need to say at the end of l423 "for those tracks"
** DONE l424: remove "particle"
** DONE l426: noise => cell noise
** DONE l429: what do you mean with the "additional layers"? Do you mean the cells with >0 energy? 
** DONE fig. 2: I think this figure is in the wrong place. It does not illustrate the clustering (as it says at l432/433) at all but instead shows the background determination. It uses a lot of terms not yet introduced, and so I suggest you move it to section 8.2.3. And, maybe you can find a better figure to illustrate the topoclustering I suggest either the recent paper or the ATLAS detector paper.
** DONE fig. 2 caption: I think the caption does not really do the figure justice either. E.g. it does not show what "E" is or what "p" is.
** DONE l442: what does "similar" mean? Remove it?
** DONE l443: we don't really know that they are noise clusters. Maybe say instead "are associated to a cluster with an energy below the noise threshold which then becomes negative after the noise subtraction." That's more correct, right?
** DONE l463: measurements => and for positively and negatively charged particles
** DONE l464: which provides a ... interaction lengths => which is used to obtain results for interaction lengths ranging between 0.1 and 0.65~$\lambda$.
** DONE l467: here you argue that the differnce must come from the hadr. interaction model. However, youa re showing FTFP_BERT and QGSP_BERT and they look pretty much the same. I suspect that this is because at low p they actually both use the BERT model. I think you need a comment on this though.
** DONE l469: I find it hard to notice a difference. And, you say that there is a difference between FTFP and QGSP at low p but they seem to be very similar!? BTW, it is not great that the y-axis range is different for a) and b), maybe this makes it hard for me to see this? I would actually prefer to reduce the scale to +-30% or so (maybe +20% and -40% is better) to really see the data
   Note here: I agree on the figure comments about the scale, and that is what I tried to do originally for the paper.
   During review we were asked to change it to the current setup to show all the errorbars.
   I wasn't sure if I should stick to public figures
** DONE fig. 2: the most striking thing for me is that the data/MC agreement gets worse at higher p. Can you comment on this?
** DONE fig. 2c+d: x-axis needs units "\lambda"
** DONE (for curiosity: did you ever make the plot vs lambda only using tracks with p>5 GeV?)
   Nope we never checked. Could take a look
** DONE l476: remove => removing an 
** DONE l497: Figure 5 => Figure 5 for data and MC with the two different physics lists. 
** DONE Fig. 5: it would be good to comment on the values themselves when you describe in the text, i.e. say that it is about 0.1 at the lowest p and then decreases to ~0.03. (In fact I am wondering if you ever looked at just the mean E versus p instead of E/p as E should be constant vs p if it is only background! So, my question is if the decrease with p is fully explained by the fact that E=const. and p is increasing?)
   I think there's a constant term from general backgrounds but also a piece that scales with p from fragmentation?
   You can see this by comparing the bin at 3 GeV (0.04) to the bin at 6 (0.035) which is higher than it would be if it were just constant I think.
   This is definitely what the MC thinks, since E/p_BG is flat from 2 to 10
** DONE l500: what does this mean? You just mean that the flux of pi0s in pythia is not right? Or, you mean that in pythia there is a coherence that there is not in data? 
   Tried to clarify - the process that produces the charged hadron also produces a pi0 pointing in about the same direction (coherent radiation)
   and pythia thinks these are either more common or more energetic than we see in data.
** DONE sec. 8.2.4, first paragraph: it would be nice to show the actual corrected E/p distribution rather than just the mean value compared to the raw spectrum to see that in particular the tail is reduced.
   I don't think we can come up with a correct actual E/p per particle, only in the aggregate. 
   We can only estimate <E/p>_BG in bins of p, eta since it uses MIPs and doesn't have a value for each particle.
   I could make a plot of E/p - <E/p>_BG from the right bin, but it would just be left-shifted
** DONE l513: would be nice to show a plot of the E/p excluding the <=0 energies to show this.
   This is seen a bit later in Figure 7 and mentioned in the text, but a version of this at the emscale would be nice to include here I agree.
   Note to self: if I don't add this plot I need to fix the text "The good agreement in that case again demonstrates..."
** DONE fig. 6a: there is a noticeable difference between the 2010 and 2012 data of ~5%? You don't comment on this in the text?
** DONE l522: moves => moves the mean value of 
** DONE l522: remove "which is the purpose of the calibration" or say "as desired"
** DONE l525: here would be a good place to now conclude that the difference in the E/p mean comes all from the zero fraction (and then remove the text at l513 which says it already but without demonstrating it)
** DONE l526: Maybe make this "8.2.5" as there is no 8.2.4.2?
** DONE l527: need reference for the "several previous measurements". 
   Oops wasn't clear that I meant the previous measurements in this document. Clarified.
** DONE l527 Also, for the next statement you need a reference. Otherwise it sounds like speculation which is not good in science.
   Added a reference, but to our own paper which makes this claim.
   Also made the phrasing less speculative
** DONE l535-540: this makes it sounds like we are not placing any cut on the TRT hits but we do have the cut at >20. So, text needs a bit rewording to make this clear. Also, the particles can get stuck in the coil and then the TRT would not matter.
** DONE l538: where... are more likely => which selects tracks that are more likely to have undergone a hadronic interaction
** DONE fig. 8: it would be interesting actually to see the 0-fraction for the two cases. That is presumably much larger for the tracks with <20 TRT hits?
** DONE l549: and each compared to the data
** DONE l550: if you want to comment on the difference betwen the two charges it would be *much* better to directly overlay the two charges, e.g. on the left for data and on the right for MC or something. It is very hard to see what you say given the small size of the plots etc. 
** DONE fig. 9: there is a difference between 2010 and 2012 you don't comment on?
** DONE l557: available => measured
** DONE l557: layer => layer separately
** DONE l565: clarify that this is for the MIP selection
** DONE l567/568: "The RAW... background" move this to footnote
** DONE l571: which has => where there is a
** DONE l572: provide reference for the "similar measurements"
** DONE Fig. 12 discussion: maybe remind the reader here that for the LAr calorimeter the material is lead while for the Tile it is steel. Also, did you make this vs lambda? Would be interesting!
** DONE l598: response => the response
** DONE l600: are you describing somewhere how secondary vertices are found? Should refer back to that.
** DONE l606: say explicitly that the higher momentum particle is the proton in 98% of the cases (I think?)
** DONE l623: explain the reason for these formulae. Also, these should be labelled m_\pi or m_p etc. I think? They are different masses depending on which particles it is I mean.
** DONE l625: the fraction of 0s is actually not so large I think?
** DONE l628: explain in more words? E.g. "annihilation of the antiquarks with quarks in the protons and neutrons of the atoms in the detector"
** DONE fig. 15: it seems to me that it is worse for pi- than pi+? But hard to see!
** DONE l638: the difference decreases with increasing p. Comment on this?
** DONE l643: does a better job" is slang ;-)
** DONE l660: where do these fractions come from? Why is there a range? You need a reference for this.
** DONE l661-663: remove statement on template method. Instead, most people would think you can use phi->KK or D->Kpi. Explain why not.
** DONE l663: "noticeable difference" w.r.t. what?
** DONE l665: say explictly thathere with low you mean <1 GeV
** DONE fig. 18: you can make this figure larger.
** DONE l670: done => obtained
** DONE l675: this is the wrong way around: we switched from QGSP (run1) to FTFP (run2)
** DONE l677: remove "small", just say the number. 5% is not really "small" if one tries to have JES uncertainties of ~1-2%
** DONE l678: there are some differences at high energies, e.g. in the 0-fraction, too.
** DONE l679: energies => momenta (?)
** DONE l681: say that the discrepancies mostly in LAr, not in Tile



* Chapter 9
** DONE general: you implicitly assume here that there are no uncertainties at all on the pi0 energy scale. This needs to be stated and justified.
** DONE l687: have often => are often
** DONE l688: photon=jet and Z-jet are also use, particularly at low and intermediate pt.
** DONE l694: components => constituents
** DONE l703: simulated distribution  => momentum distribution of simulated particles
** DONE l707-709: not sure about this first sentence. Can phrase this better, e.g. "A correct modeling of jets in the data by simulation requires that both the particle production inside jets as well as the response of the calorimeter to particles are correctly modeled." 
** DONE l708: table ref not resolved
** DONE fig. 19: 
    - Is this really energy or p? Is it the truth value? presumably yes?
    - Comment more about the figure. Say e.g. that for 90-100 GeV jets less than 1% of the particles contributing have >20 GeV energy etc.
    - The y-axis label is not clear. 
** DONE l721: why are there no uncertainties related to the particle composition? This needs to be justified. I presume it was considered to be beyond the scope of this? Normally there should be uncertainties on the composition.
** DONE l725: are => is
** DONE table 1: 
    - is this E/p for the LCW?
    - how can I understand the 1-5% uncertainty in the "in situ E/p" row? Can I relate this to the plots from the previous chapter? If so, how exactly. Maybe the previous chapter should conclude on what the actual uncertainty on the response is then at the end.
    - remove "flat" from the last row. or say "independent of energy" instead of "flat"
** DONE fig. 20: when describing it in the text on previous page, it would be good to comment on what we see, e.g. that the mean is slightly below 1.0, that it is pretty flat with jet pT, what the total uncertainty is...
** DONE fig. 20 caption: The JES => The JES response 
** DONE fig. 21: this caption should say a bit more and also the y-axis label needs to be pT and not log(pT).


First Round

* Chapter 5
** DONE L563 : probably break this sentence in two
** DONE L570 : maybe cite LEP somehow, like the TDR or something?
** DONE L580 : maybe just cite them at first mention, idk what's better though
** DONE L586 : something like "first full run" to avoid objections about 2008 quench
** DONE L651 : drop "Specifically" since this is a new section
** DONE L663 : drop "In all"
** DONE L690 : cite RF cavities?
** DONE L733-743 : beta vs beta star would probably be unclear to someone unfamiliar with this notation
** DONE L735 : isn't it technically the normalized emittance in this equation? in particular, might be nice to note that epsilon_n decreases with energy (part of why we have such higher insta lumi at 13 TeV etc)
** DONE L751 vs next paragraph : f_rev is pretty important and we did have 50ns data too, so maybe mention it here?
** DONE L762 : might be good to be consistent with the use of bunches vs buckets (jargon anyway, so maybe in quotes or something the first time)
** DONE L768 : "In practice,"
** DONE L768 : we have gotten to full design lumi now, right?
** DONE L771 : units for lumi??
** DONE L727 vs L772 : insta lumi vs int lumi.  It might be easiest to just always attach one of these
** DONE L774 : rewrite sentence
** DONE L777 : I would write '"good" for physics ' since this not really explained beforehand. it's really jargon since we use a the Good-RL
** DONE L780 : This sentence is pretty confusing to me
** DONE L782 : mu isn't really a name for pileup. probably just have a sentence like "Pileup is the term used to describe the additional interactions per bunch crossing, which can be quantified by the number of additional proton-proton interactions npv"
** DONE L783 vs L784 : use of "event" differs here.  Use event for each bunch crossing, and something like "additional proton-proton interaction" for pileup
** DONE Might actually want to rewrite this section on pileup?
* Chapter 11
** DONE l824: nice to provide a range (or even better a plot) of betas for a given mass ?
** DONE l829: I would say effective for its discriminating power and for its use in reconstructing particle mass. A feature is it can be used for many masses and lifetimes.
** DONE l830: Momentum is argubably also a key selection variable, I think it's worth mentioning its importance early on.
** DONE l831: "form a complete search" means what? to reduce background? make this more precise as it doesn't mean much now.
** DONE l832: not sure this is true. In principle I think that dE/dx could be available at the high level trigger level, as it runs a version of the standard reco. It's not used, but I'm not sure you can say it's not available
** DONE l834: "can be inefficient", "often large" --> do you make these more quantitative later on?
** DONE l836: This sentence is a little confusing, because ionization is not more effective for high momentum tracks, it's just that there are low momentum tracks w/ high ionizationd from SM. Not sure that comes under the word "effective" (though effective may apply for quality cuts though.)
** DONE l838: "In particular" --> this sentence isn't a subset of the previous one, I found the "in particular" confusing
** DONE l863: "remains" -- reword unless you discussed this for previous analses earlier
** DONE l686: do you say elsewhere why this introduces a model dependence on calo interaction? if not, better to spell it out here
** DONE l875-879: mention ISR jets here somewhere?
** DONE Section 11.1: I think this section needs to be expanded a little, and could be extended a lot. You need to define somewhere how the MET trigger works (how is MET defined and built?), and what the thresholds are at different levels for the trigger we used. Might also be nice to discuss the turn on or show a plot of MET in signal before trigger requirement.
** DONE l894: these numbers are true for all masses and lifetimes? also, worth explicitly saying eff. are after trigger (otherwise people not reading closley are confused because the numbers seem high)
** DONE l905: I think it is worth mentioning why it's OK that we don't cut on the trigger plateau, and including one of your trigger plateau plots.
** DONE l905: I think it is interesting to add a section on signal region optimization, as you put a fair amount of work into the process.
** DONE l931: include a few examples of physics processes that can give these types of tracks? (photon conversions, pion decays?)
** DONE l933: maybe check with Simone,but I think it should be "multiple particles" instead of "multiple tracks" as you just said the tracks can not be resolved
** DONE l933: what variables does the NN use to make this classification? would be nice to explain a bit what the NN is doing.
** DONE l946: maybe not use the word isolation as you're using a non-standard isolatoin tool and people might think you mean the standard one?
** DONE 11.3: First sentence is not a complete set of the backgrounds, and first few sentences are a bit confusing. Different cuts target different backgrounds. You can get backgrounds from heavy low momentum particles (protons etc), which is why we cut on p. You can get backgrounds from overlapping particles (--> cut on isolation and split/shared.) You can get backgrounds from Landau tail too, which is what I think you're referring to, but I would rewrite the intro sentence(s) to this section to be a more complete list, or make it clear you're talking about a subset of backgrounds. Also, I would mention specifically the tail of the Landau distribution (as this is different than random high dE/dx from electronic noise, etc..)
** DONE Also, maybe you want to rename the section; all the cuts reject standard model particles; this section focues on electron, hadron, and muon vetos specifically.
** DONE l982; give a number for long-life time v. intermeidate life time?
** DONE l986: this setence is a bit confusing, you are trying to distinguish from the nsplit/ nshared hits cut? maybe add that in explicilty? I think otherwise the way it's written is a little confusing
** DONE l989: additional particles with momentum above x? (some very low momentum hadrons could also be produced I think?)
** DONE l990: did you define delta R already?
** DONE l994: "significantly less than 1% of signal events have pTCone above 20 GeV" or something... right now there's a subject/verb problem with the "and" (it's not the pTCone that's 1%)
** DONE l995: one of the most effective? what are the other effective ways? why choose this over those? Maybe better to say, "a very effective way..."
** DONE l998: there's no way around the fact that it seems odd to tighten it for the stable case but not for metastable... I think it's OK the way you've written it, but someone might ask why not for metastable?  so you could address that quesiton in the text if you want (but I understand why you may not want to!)
** DONE l1004: maybe you should define what is a medium muon? (pT, eta, quality?)
** DONE l1018: why beacuse of calibration? Might be worth spelling out.
** DONE 1019: define zero fraction
** DONE l1023-1039: this section is quite good, but dense. It may be clearer to someone who hasn't thought it through already if you make seperate paragrapsh to discuss fem and E/p, but on the other hand may not be worth the effort...
** DONE l1044: listing the candidation mass as a final requirement is a bit misleading, as it sounds like it's a discrete cut like the ionizaiton, rather than a sliding window for each mass hypothesis.
** DONE l1056: technically it's just the Bethe formula now I think for some reason Bloch got dropped...
** DONE l1059: why this range of Beta? Does it not perform well in other ranges?
** DONE l1058: if I were your advisor, I would ask how you get from the Landau-Vavilov and Bethe distribution to this parameteric 
        I assume you talk about how to measure dE/dx (per pixel using ToT, but also the truncuated mean approach, and the details of IBL v. Pixel for track dE/dx) in another section?
** DONE l1068: might be nice to add the plot of reco. mass v. true mass to justify this 3% correction
** DONE l1071: is the width from dE/dx or from momentum measurement?
** DONE 1075: clarify that this is done with signal MC
** DONE l1082: not sure why you are highlighting the rejection power of SM and ionization together?
** DONE l1089: it's the ioniziation cut that causes the most mass dependence? not momentum or MET (at low mass?)
** DONE l1103: might be nice to include some of your accepctance / efficiency tables here, for more complete info than we put into the paper version

* Chapter 12
** DONE 1110: "So" --> "Therefore"; so is too colloquial
** DONE 1111: "like" --> "including"; same as above
** DONE 1114: "these reasons" --> "this reason" (unless you listed more than one? I only see the lack of reproduction of outliers?)
** DONE 1117: I would add "Standard Model" charged particles to the very beginning, since our signal doesn't fall into this category. Maybe overkill, but I think better to be explicit.
** DONE 1120: I would say "samples of tracks from each"
** DONE 1132-1133: What do you mean, momnetum is expected to vary significantly? Can you be more precise / descriptive?
** DONE 1137: why are muons better isolated? Spell it out.
** DONE 1146: "independence of ionization and other aspects of the event" --> "independence between ionization and other kinematic variables in the event"
** DONE 1148: "dE/dx is not correlated with momentum" -- that's not really true. I would say, to the level that we can measure it, or to the level that is significant, or that it's not very correlated.... but because of relativisitic rise you can't make that statement as is.
** DONE 1153: probably better to make this clearer; you get a sample of dE/dx and p from the random generations, then use those to estimate mass based on the parameterization
** DONE 1162-1163: need to reword slightly; the dE/dx template is not just in the signal region, also in the low dE/dx region used for normalization (techincally only the high dE/dx part is in the signal region)
** DONE 1179 and 1181: confusing chronology; you say "is then normalized" and then "this normalization takes place before"
** DONE 1205: "Their" --> "There"
** DONE 1207: Why does the background method underestimate the tail of the mass distribution? Why does this go away after the ionization requirement? You should at least provide some hypotheses.
** DONE Do you discuss the uncertainties on the background estimate seperately? I think it's important to spell out the way that the statistical uncertainty is estimated, as well as the different systematics. But maybe you have a seperate uncertainty section. If so, reference it at the end here.
   In the next chapter, trying to avoid the forward reference.
** DONE About electron muon pt tails 
   muons: badly reconstructed p at high momentum. Muons are hard to reconstruct at high p, and the W' search makes very tight selections to ensure good reco.
   electrons: maybe background slipping in? I'm not as familiar with problems of high p electron performance, but it could be that you have some hadron contaimination. But I'm not sure how that could influence the tail you see.

*** Optimization Procedure
** Background Method
*** Detailed SR distributions

* Chapter 3
** DONE - You are lacking references for many claims.
** DONE - You are missing the running of the masses which explains why the gluino is heavier than the photino for instance. I think you should at least show a typical SUSY mass spectrum but maybe even the plot vs Q and show the running.
** DONE l1220: sufficient => sufficient to
** DONE l1224: this is not true it is the simplest extension of the Higgs sector. Non-minimal models have more scalars. 
** DONE l1255: the statement that they all need sparticles at TeV scale is not really true. E.g. the unity of the forces just requires <100000 TeV if I remember well. Lawrence Hall studied things in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5301.pdf. Maybe you can check the statement and/or add a reference for it?
** DONE l1268: need references for statement
** DONE l1276: need reference (see above)
** DONE l1278: definte WIMP
** DONE sec. 3.3: I don't agree with this introduction. Maybe check the SUSY primer again. The MSSM is the minimal model in the sense that it has a minimal extension of the Higgs sector. It has a lot of parameters and most others are part of it. Maybe you are confusing MSSM with mSUGRA?
   I would just say that the "simplified models" are focussing on being model-independent in the sense that they focus just on the particles that matter for a given experimental search and don't assume relations between masses. 
   This needs major rephrasing I think and it is probably best to not use the word "model" for the so-called simplified models as this is very confusing. 
   You can get around using that In think in your case as you simply just look for one particle (gluino) which does either not decay or decay to the LSP. 
   If you point to the mass spectrum, and where the squark masses are you can explain why they matter but that we use lifetime rather than squark mass (which you do later anyway).
** DONE l1328/1329: reverse these two models to reflect chronological order (both are part of MSSM BTW)


* Conclusion
** DONE summary: here also a comparison with CMS is missing.
** DONE l4056: most competitive => strongest
** DONE l4063: would => will


* General
** DONE - I am missing still an explanation of what the cross section is and ideally a plot of the cross section vs mass also. I mean something like here on page 3:
   https://gsalam.web.cern.ch/gsalam/repository/talks/2009-Bautzen-lecture2.pdf. This explains how the PDFs are convoluted with the ME to give the cross section. And, then you could show a cross section plot and say how many events are expected to be produced in 3.2.fb at some mass value.
** DONE - I am also missing a discussion of what we know about SUSY experimentally. Including a run-1 summary plot of SUSY searches would be good. And, a discussion of it (brief)
** DONE fig. 44 and 46: the plots are rotated
